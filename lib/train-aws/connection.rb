# Connection definition file for an example Train plugin.

# Most of the work of a Train plugin happens in this file.
# Connections derive from Train::Plugins::Transport::BaseConnection,
# and provide a variety of services.  Later generations of the plugin
# API will likely separate out these responsibilities, but for now,
# some of the responsibilities include:
# * authentication to the target
# * platform / release /family detection
# * caching
# * API execution
# * marshalling to / from JSON
# You don't have to worry about most of this.

# Push platform detection out to a mixin, as it tends
# to develop at a different cadence than the rest
