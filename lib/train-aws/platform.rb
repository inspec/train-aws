    # The method `platform` is called when platform detection is
    # about to be performed.  Train core defines a sophisticated
    # system for platform detection, but for most plugins, you'll
    # only ever run on the special platform for which you are targeting.

      # If you are declaring a new platform, you will need to tell
      # Train a bit about it.

      # of the cloud family.

      # This plugin defines a new platform.

      # force_platform! lets you bypass platform detection.

      # Use release to report a version number.  You might use the version
      # of the plugin, or a version of an important underlying SDK, or a
      # version of a remote API.
